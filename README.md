# 'Would You Rather'

## Project Overview

The "Would You Rather?" app, lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The CSS and navigation are from the reactnd-chirper-app project.
